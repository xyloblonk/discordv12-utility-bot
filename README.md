# Discord.js v12 Utility Bot
A utility bot built using Discord.js v12

## Current Status
This bot is currently a work in progress. While it functions, the codebase is heavily tailored to a single guild and contains a lot of unoptimized, legacy logic. It's being maintained primarily for personal/community use until Discord.js v12 becomes completely incompatible with current API features.

## Future Plans
A full refactor is planned to support multi-guild functionality. This will require significant rewrites including overhauling the database system, command and event handlers, configuration structure, and command logic. Expect progress to be gradual as the entire foundation needs modernization. I'll likely update this to have v12, v13, and v14 versions. Maybe I'll even add docker files, and addons. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
